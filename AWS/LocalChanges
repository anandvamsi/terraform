Why we should not code locally 
- case of system crash
- collabrative managment 

Files having sensitive information are not the idle solutions to push the Git repository.
- config files having passwords
- tfstate files having passwords


Using .gitignore
---------------------
Files to ignore during the git push
- .terraform  :- folder will be created when terraform init is run
- .terrafrm.tfvars :- likely contains sensitive data like username/password and secrets
- terraform.tfstate :-  should be staores in remote side
- crash.log :- if terraform crashes, the logs are stored to a file named crash.log

contents of .gitignore files
----------------------------------
.terraform 
*.tfvars
terraform.tfstate
