Terraform supports various types of remote backends which can be used to store state data.
As of now, we storing state date in local and GIT repository
Depending on remote backends which is being used, there can few features

- Standard backend:- state Storage Locking
- Enhanced Backed Types :- All features + Remote Management 


Using backed s3

terraform {
  backend  "s3" {
  bucket = "<bucketname>"
  region = "" 
  accesskey =
  secreatkey  =     
    
   }
 }

Understanding State Lock
-------------------------
Whenever you are performing write operation,terraform would lock the state file.
THis is very important as otherwise during your onging terraform apply operations,if others also try for the same,it would corrupt your state file.

Example;-
Person A is terminating the RDS resource which has associated rds file.
Person B has now tried resizing the same RDS resource at the same time.

Intergration with DynamoDB Locking 
-----------------------------------
Step1
- Create  table in DynamoDB
  - create a PrimaryKey :- LockID
  
Step2 
terraform {
  backend  "s3" {
  bucket = "<bucketname>"
  region = "" 
  accesskey =
  secreatkey  =     
  dynamodb_table = <Mention the one created in the step1>  
   }
 }

step3
  terraform init
  
step4:
    terraform plan
    Now check the dynamo DB table ;- There will be entry which wil added on.
