Implicit dependency:
By studying the resource attributes used in interpolation expressions, Terraform can automatically infer when one resource depends on another.
Terraform uses this dependency information to determine the correct order in which to create the different resources.
Implicit dependencies via interpolation expressions are the primary way to inform Terraform about these relationships, 
and should be used whenever possible.

Example of Implicit dependency
>>>>>>

provider "aws" {
  profile    = "default"
  region     = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-b374d5"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
resource "aws_eip" "ip" {
    vpc = true
    instance = aws_instance.example.id
}


Explicit dependency:
--------------------
Sometimes there are dependencies between resources that are not visible to Terraform.
The depends_on argument is accepted by any resource and accepts a list of resources to create explicit dependencies for.
>>>>

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "some_bucket"
  acl    = "private"
}
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-2757f631"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.example]
}
