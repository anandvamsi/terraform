Sentinal //Policy as code
Sentinel is an embedded policy-as-code framework integrated with the HashiCorp Enterprise products. 
It enables fine-grained, logic-based policy decisions, and can be extended to use information from external sources.

Benefits of Sentinal
-----------------------

Codifying policy removes the need for ticketing queues, without sacrificing enforcement.

One of the other benefits of Sentinel is that it also has a full testing framework.

Avoiding a ticketing workflow allows organizations to provide more self-service capabilities and end-to-end automation, minimizing the friction for developers and operators
