Imagine a case where you want to create resources in different region using same code 
one EIP needs to be created in ap-south-1
one EIP needs to be created in us-west-2

provider "aws" {
region = "us-west-2"
}


provider "aws" {
alias = "mumbai"
region = "us-south-1"
}

-------------
resource "aws_eip" "eip" {
vpc = true
}

resource "aws_eip" "eip01" {
vpc = "true"
provider = "aws.mumbai

"
}


usecase:-
Why do we need multiple providers:-
Some of the example scenarios:
a. multiple regions for a cloud platform
b. targeting multiple Docker hosts
c. multiple Consul hosts, etc.
