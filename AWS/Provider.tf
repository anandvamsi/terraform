# Provider

A provider in Terraform is a plugin that enables interaction with an API. This includes cloud providers, SaaS providers, and other APIs. The providers are specified in the Terraform configuration code. They tell Terraform which services it needs to interact with.

Here is an example of how to use the aws provider in a Terraform configuration:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "ami-0123456789abcdef0" # Change the AMI 
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

Here are some other examples of providers:

- `azurerm` - for Azure
- `google` - for Google Cloud Platform
- `kubernetes` - for Kubernetes
- `openstack` - for OpenStack
- `vsphere` - for VMware vSphere
