Terraform fmt 
The canonical format may change in minor ways between Terraform versions, so after upgrading Terraform we recommend to 
proactively run terraform fmt on your modules along with any other changes you are making to adopt the new version.

To see the difference in the terraform fmt
terraform fmt -diff

TO fmt the subsquent folders also.
terraform fmt -recursive


You are formatting configuration files in a lot of directories and you donâ€™t
want to see the list of file changes. What is the flag that you should use?
terraform fmt -list=false
