A "backend" in Terraform determines how state is loaded and how an operation such as apply is executed.
This abstraction enables non-local file state storage, remote execution, etc.
By default, Terraform uses the "local" backend, which is the normal behavior of Terraform

By default tfstate file will present in working directory.

if you want different tfstate file
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

terraform {
  backend "local" {
     path = "/tmp/mydata.tfstate"
    }
}
