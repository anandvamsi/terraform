The terraform refresh command is used to reconcile the state Terraform knows about (via its state file) with the real-world infrastructure.
This can be used to detect any drift from the last-known state, and to update the state file.

The command refresh does not modify infrastructure, but does modify the state file. 
If the state is changed, this may cause changes to occur during the next plan or apply.


Benefits of backend
--------------------

Working in a team: Backends can store their state remotely and protect that state with locks to prevent corruption. Some backends such as Terraform Cloud even automatically store a history of all state revisions.

Keeping sensitive information off disk: State is retrieved from backends on demand and only stored in memory. If youâ€™re using a backend such as Amazon S3, the only location the state ever is persisted is in S3.

Remote operations: For larger infrastructures or certain changes, terraform apply can take a long, long time. Some backends support remote operations which enable the operation to execute remotely. You can then turn off your computer and your operation will still complete. 
Paired with remote state storage and locking above, this also helps in team environmen
