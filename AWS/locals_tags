what is locals
locals
local values can be helpful to avoid repeating the same values or expression multiple times in a configrations 
Locals are (in my opinion) variables but when you don't need to change the variable (local) VALUE, however when you still need to re-use it. If we were to use variables, we are would be changing the value constantly to match our new resource. With locals,
we understand we will have to use the same value more than an N-number of times, so we just create a local.




provider "aws" {
region = "us-east-1"
}

locals {
common_tags = {
        Owners = "Devops team"
        service = "backend"
        }
}

resource "aws_iam_user" "admin1" {
name = "admin2"
tags = local.common_tags
}

This will create IAM user with tags while teaching explain the manual process also.



Examples2:-
provider "aws" {
region = "us-east-1"
}

locals {
common_tags = {
        Owners = "Devops team"
        service = "backend"
        }
}

resource "aws_iam_user" "admin1" {
name = "admin2"
tags = local.common_tags
}

resource "aws_instance" "admin1" {
ami = "ami-02e136e904f3da870"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
tags = local.common_tags

}
